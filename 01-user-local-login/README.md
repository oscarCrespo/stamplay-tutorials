========================================

## What youâ€™ll learn

This tutorial explains how to register users with email and password.

## The demo

You can find a functioning demo here: https://locallogin.stamplayapp.com

## Using this example 

- Open the [Stamplay Editor](https://editor.stamplay.com) and create a new application. You do not need to do anything else, because any Stamplay app can register users with email and password by default.
- Deploy the static files on Stamplay hosting or on your server.

### Using Stamplay hosting

In order to use the Stamplay hosting you need to: 
- Install the Stamplay [command line tool](https://stamplay.com/docs/hosting)
- Clone this repository
- [Deploy](https://stamplay.com/docs/hosting#deploying) the files in the folder 01-user-local-login

### Using your hosting

You can use your own hosting and just make API calls towards Stamplay endpoints. You need to:
- Deploy the files in the folder 01-user-local-login
- Open your app in the [Stamplay Editor](https://editor.stamplay.com), select Hosting from the main menu and add your domain to the CORS settings
